# Battery-Monitor
 Monitor and logging of battery information

Used for health checks on portable computers that users are complaining about short battery life.
Does not load CPU to burn battery, only monitors when a system is plugged/unplugged & notifies of battery levels as configured in settings.
Optionally can log output to file.
